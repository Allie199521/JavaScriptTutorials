#JavaScript Running Tutorial
#Author: Allie Miranda

1) Create your document, it will end with .js
   for example: test.js
   Save this in your project folder.

2) Open test.js [this is just the example name we will use throughout]
   Use your favorite text editor, Atom is cool, Sublime is very cool.
   Don't forget to save as you go!

3) Create some code!
   Here is a small example: document.write("Hello World!");
   What do you think this code will do?

4) To run test.js from your console, you have to have software to support it.
   However, JavaScript is most importantly used for web dev.
   This means, to use test.js without the supporting software - we need html.

5) Create a html file.
   For instance: test.html
   Save this in your project folder
   ***IMPORTANT*** Your test.js and test.html have to be in the same folder OR
   You have to make sure that you write the correct pathname!

6) Open test.html [this is the name we will use throughout]
   Using your text editor [same as step 2, but I mean, change it up if you want]

7) For now, I will give you some code to work with, copy the following:
   <html>
     <head>
       <script src="test.js"></script>
     </head>
   </html>
   ***IMPORTANT*** Make sure that you put in the name of your .js!
   Save!

8) Now, find where test.html is saved and you can double click it.
   It should open in your browser!
   If Hello World! (Or whatever you typed in between the "") is not on your page,
   you may want to refer back to step 3 and try again.
   Else you did it! Proud of you!

9) Since you know how to run some JavaScript in your browser, keep playing!
